          Beagles are small to medium-sized dogs with short, smooth coats that come in a variety of colors, including white, black, brown, and tan. The Beagle
          temperament is characterized by a friendliness, playfulness, intelligence, and a happy-go-lucky spirit. Originally from England, Beagles were first
          bred to track small game, such as rabbits and foxes. This can lead them astray if they catch a scent during outdoor walks, so owners should ensure
          their dogs are on a leash to prevent them from wandering too far. They are still used for hunting today, but they are also popular as companion dogs.
          This breed are relatively low-maintenance dogs, and they require regular exercise and grooming.

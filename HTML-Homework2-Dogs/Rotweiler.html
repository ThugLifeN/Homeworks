          The Rottweiler is a large, muscular dog breed with an iconic
          appearance that is known for its strength and loyalty. Originating
          from the town of Rottweil in Germany, they have a history dating back
          to the Roman Empire, where they were used as herding and guarding
          dogs. Today, German Rottweilers are renowned for their versatility and
          serve as exceptional working dogs, excelling in roles such as police
          work, search and rescue, and service dogs. They are characterized by
          their strong build, with a broad head, well-developed muscles, and a
          distinctive black and tan coat that is short and dense.

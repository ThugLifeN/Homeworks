          The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German
          breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed
          by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs
          from 1899. It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep.
          It has since been used in many other types of work, including
          disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It
          is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération
          Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual
          registrations in 2013.
